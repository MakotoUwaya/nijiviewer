# Code Sample

```js filename="demo.js" {3} copy
let a = 1;

console.log(a);
```

## Component

Since syntax highlighting is done at build time, you can't use dynamic content
in your code blocks. However, since MDX is very powerful there is a workaround
via client JS. For example:

import { DynamicCode } from './_dynamic-code';

<DynamicCode>
```js copy=false filename="demo.js"
function hello() {
  const x = 2 + 3
  console.log(1)
}
```
</DynamicCode>
